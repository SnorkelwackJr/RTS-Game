# RTS-Game (Planetside 2 meets Company of Heroes)

Let's sketch out some ideas for mechanics and world building here.

Faction Ideas
- Neo-Roman Empire
- Scrappers

Mechanic Ideas
- Zones/stations are powered by a unique power source owned by each faction. Taking over another faction's zone allows you to capture some of the power source to use as tech tree research.
- Scrappers slowly build larger units by salvaging from debris. They can repair damaged units with salvage (patching them with unique parts). They can sacrifice bots or small mechs toward mechanical mega projects.
- Nero Empire mega religious. Must do rituals to bless their newly created units. If not, it could be cursed. Monks have multiple levels of experience increasing the chances of a successfull ritual.
